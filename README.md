Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Overview
The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a C# application designed to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activities or intrusions. This project captures network packets in real-time, analyzes them for potential threats, and alerts the user if any anomalies or known attack signatures are detected. It provides detailed logging for further analysis.

Features
Real-time network traffic analysis
Detection of suspicious activities and anomalies
Alerting mechanisms with console output and logging
Simple and extensible design for future enhancements

Prerequisites
.NET Core 3.1 or .NET 5/6/7 (depending on the version of .NET used in the project)
PcapDotNet library (for packet capturing)
Elevated permissions (administrator or root) may be required for network capturing
